1. §z§ axis in rotation or linear axis.
2. §x§-axis is perpendicular to both §z\_(i-1)§ and §z_i§.

§d_i§: distance to new origin along §z\_(i-1)§ axis.

§theta_i§: angle about §z\_(i-1)§ to align §x\_(i-1)§ with §x_i§.

§a_i§ is the distance along the rotated §x_i§ axis.

§alpha_i§ rotates about new §x_i§ axist a to align §z\_(i-1)§ with §z_1§.
